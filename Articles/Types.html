                    <h3> Tent Camping: The Classic</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tent camping is the classic and most traditional form of camping. Indeed, a tent is the first thing that we associate with camping. Tent camping involves setting up a tent at a campsite or in the wilderness, immersing campers in the natural environment with only the most essential comforts. Tent campers carry their gear and supplies, making it an ideal option for those seeking a closer connection with nature and a sense of living off the land.

                    <h3>RV Camping: For Those Roadtrip Lovers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Recreational Vehicles (RVs) have transformed the camping experience, providing mobile homes with modern comforts like kitchens, bathrooms, and sleeping areas. RV camping offers comfort and convenience, allowing travelers to explore various destinations while enjoying the comforts of home on wheels. Although the areas you could explore in one of these is smaller compared to other types of camping, many would agree that the comforts it offers more than make up for any drawbacks it could have.

                    <h3>Backpacking: Travelling Light</h3>
                    <p>
                        Backpacking involves carrying essential gear and supplies in a backpack while hiking through wilderness areas. This type of camping offers unparalleled exploration opportunities, taking campers to remote and less-visited locations where they can fully immerse themselves in the wilderness. 
                    </p>
                    <div class = "article-img">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Backpacking has become a much beloved recreational activity; due to its relatively low budget and the aforementioned range of exploration it provides. On a good day, many backpackers can be seen trekking through our very own shrublands and moors, seeking the thrill and adventure that connecting with nature provides.

                    <h3>Car Camping: When Living In Your Car Is A Good Thing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Car camping is a popular option for campers who prefer a mix of comfort and outdoor adventure. Campsites accessible by car make it convenient to transport camping gear and enjoy the benefits of both tent camping and easy access to your vehicle. When compared with RV camping, car camping may seem cramped and a little uncomfortable, but it allows you to have fun and enjoy the great outdoors on a much lower budget. And if the great outdors feel like they are not so great after all, you could always turn around and drive back home with no fuss at all.

                    <h3>Glamping: A Mansion in the Woods</h3>
                    <p>
                        Glamping, short for glamorous camping, offers a luxurious and indulgent camping experience. Accommodations range from lavish tents with comfortable beds and furnishings to eco-friendly treehouses and stylish yurts. Glamping is perfect for those who desire a unique blend of nature and luxury. Camping doesn't neccessarily have to mean a tent, and if this is your style, then it's your lucky day! Because nature can be enjoyed from a luxury treehouse just as much as it can be enjoyed from a tent.

                    <h3>Canoe/ Kayak Camping: If You Don't Mind Getting Wet</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ideal for water enthusiasts, canoe or kayak camping involves paddling to remote campsites along rivers, lakes, or coastlines. Campers load their gear into the boat and embark on unforgettable aquatic adventures, camping in picturesque waterfront locations. If you like the rocking of a boat as much as you like the sound of crickets around you at night, then this activity is sure to satisfy your heart. As long as you remember to add a lifejacket to your inventory.
