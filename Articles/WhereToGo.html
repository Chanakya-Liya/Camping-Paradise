                    <p>
                        It is important to keep in mind that these are just a handful of spots in the world and whether or not they are the best is entirely up to you. What can be said though, is that camping and hiking go hand in hand and are two wonderful and satisfying recreational activites that everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime. Regardless of whether you visit one of these spots, or whether you find a place on google, or even if you visit that one little thicket that your grandfather said he went to, camping will always leave you both completely satisfied and wanting more at the same time.
